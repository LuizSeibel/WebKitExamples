# WebKitExamples

This repository contains a series of practical examples demonstrating how to use **WebKit**, Apple's powerful framework for rendering web content. These examples showcase various functionalities, from simply displaying a web page to more advanced interactions like JavaScript injection.

## Included Examples:

Here are the examples you'll find in this project:

1.  **Show URL:**
    * This demonstrates the most basic way to load and display a URL within a `WKWebView`. It's ideal for understanding the fundamental flow of web content display.

2.  **Non-existent URL:**
    * This example illustrates how to handle errors when the provided URL doesn't correspond to an existing page. It's essential for building robust applications that inform the user about navigation issues.

3.  **URL without HTTPS:**
    * Shows how WebKit behaves when attempting to load a URL that doesn't use the secure HTTPS protocol. It's important to understand the security implications and how WebKit handles such cases.

4.  **JavaScript Injection into Site:**
    * Explore the capability to inject JavaScript code directly into a web page loaded in the `WKWebView`. This opens doors for DOM manipulation, interaction with page elements, and bidirectional communication between native code and JavaScript.

5.  **Simple Browser:**
    * A basic web browser example, integrating URL loading functionalities, navigation (forward/back), and potentially an address bar. It serves as a starting point for creating a more comprehensive browser.
