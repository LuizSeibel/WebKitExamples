# WebKitExamples

This repository contains a series of practical examples demonstrating how to use **WebKit**, Apple's powerful framework for rendering web content. These examples showcase various functionalities, from simply displaying a web page to more advanced interactions like JavaScript injection.

## Included Examples:

Here are the examples you'll find in this project:

1.  **Show URL:**
    * This demonstrates the most basic way to load and display a URL within a `WKWebView`. It's ideal for understanding the fundamental flow of web content display.

2.  **JavaScript Injection into Site:**
    * Explore the capability to inject JavaScript code directly into a web page loaded in the `WKWebView`. This opens doors for DOM manipulation, interaction with page elements, and bidirectional communication between native code and JavaScript.

3.  **Simple Browser:**
    * A basic web browser example, integrating URL loading functionalities and an address bar. It serves as a starting point for creating a more comprehensive browser.
